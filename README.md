Kendo Tournament Manager v2 is a complete rebuild of the old
tool [Kendo Tournament Generator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kendotournament/files/) with the effort of adapting
it to the modern technologies. The new architecture allows the deployment of this tool as a web application -rather than
a desktop application- allowing some advantages such as better compatibility between devices, as now can be used in any
Android/iOS system as a standard webpage, or better scoring synchronization between multiple devices as now everything
is centralized in one server.

## Installation

### Compiling from the sourcecode

Please, download the complete project from [here](https://github.com/softwaremagico/KendoTournamentManager). The project
is divided in two parts `frontend` and `backend`. Each one must be run separately.

#### Frontend Component

The frontend is developed using Angular. All information related to the use and execution of the frontend can be
found [here](./frontend/README.md).

#### Backend Component

The backend component is developed in Java. You can find all the information of compiling and running the backend on
this [Readme](./backend/README.md) file. Be sure you read the documentation, as there are some default keys that must be
changed.

##### Database Storage

Backend needs a database to persist all data. You can fit easily any of your preferred database providers. Please,
check [the documentation](./backend/README.md) about how to configure the database.

### Using Docker

The application can also be deployed as a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. If you want to deploy it as a
docker, please read the [docker guide](./docker/README.md) of this project. This is the preferred way of deploying the
application and probably the easiest way if you feel comfortable using docker

# Default credentials.
The default user is `admin@test` with password `asd123`. This user is an admin user that can create new users. Remember to change the password or remove this account.
