# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Configure

On the [environment folder](src/environments) there are multiple files to store the configuration variables for the
server. As it is serving multiples environments, edit the ones you need (probably `environment.prod.ts`).

Set the backend server url if needed. You probably must update it, if the frontend and the backend are running on
different hosts.

```
backendUrl: "http://localhost:8080/kendo-tournament-backend"
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

Run `ng serve --configuration=production` for a production server.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project (or `ng build --configuration=production`). The build artifacts will be stored in
the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
